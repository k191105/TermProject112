Project Description:

PageRank Simulator is an interactive simulator that demonstrates how PageRank works by visualizing the "random surfer" model. The vision is that users can create their own networks by adding web pages and defining links between themâ€”architecturing, so to speak, their own miniature internet. The simulator then displays a random surfer, and the way in which it interacts with the internet, ultimately showing how PageRank calculates the importance of each page based on in and out-going link structures. Users have a high degree of control over customizability, being able to add, move and dete pages and experiment with different simulation parameters and settings. 

Run Intructions:

1. Download Python 3
2. Download cmu_graphics into project directory. Follow instructions: https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/desktop
3. Install all required libraries. Run the following command:
    pip install numpy random math

To start the simulator, make sure you are in the correct project directory, then run the file 'app.py' in terminal using:
    python app.py

Shortcut Commands:

1. Space button: Press the space button to start the simulator when on the start screen;
2. 'r': press r to return to start screen and reset all settings, graphs and data;
3. 'd' or 'backspace': press d or backspace to delete any node while selected.
